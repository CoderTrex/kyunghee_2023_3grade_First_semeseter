# Game Engineering

## Overview

This directory contains materials and assignments for the "Game Engineering" course in the first semester of the third grade at Kyunghee University. The course focuses on advanced topics in game development, particularly on upgrading fluid simulation techniques using GPU. 

The primary project for this course is an upgrade of the "Fast Fluid Simulations with Sparse Volumes on the GPU," which is detailed in a separate repository: [gvdb-fluid-unreal](https://github.com/Tyranno-Rex/gvdb-fluid-unreal). This README will primarily focus on the course lectures and materials.
